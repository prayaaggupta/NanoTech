# NanoTech
Using Kwant (a Python package) in order to model and simulate graphene structures and other tight-binding models. I used this when conducting research with the NanoTech Institute at the University of Texas @ Dallas under Dr. Xiaoyan Shi and Dr. Jian Liao. I attempted to then create graphene samples in real life and use Kwant to model these samples, determine their thickness, etc.
